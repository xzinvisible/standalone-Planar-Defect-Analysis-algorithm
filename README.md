# Standalone Planar Defect Analysis algorithm (PDA)
Based on the [planar-defect-analysis-algorithm](https://github.com/superssy/planar-defect-analysis-algorithm), which worked with the python script modifier of [OVITO Pro](https://www.ovito.org/). The original script is here [PDA.py](/PDA.py).  
The modified version allows performing PDA without Ovito Pro, using the Ovito python module, and output the result into the specified file.
